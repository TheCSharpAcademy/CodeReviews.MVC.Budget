==Budget Tracker==
 App made with asp.net MVC paradigm but with modals for CRUD operations. Project was made with (C# Academy)[https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/27/budget].

==How to run==
Open app in terminal .\BudgetMVC.hasona23\Budget.hasona23\Budget.hasona23 then type
``` dotnet build```
``` dotnet run  ```
this will open a console window for the localhost server and then opens the website.

==Details==
The project you can do CRUD operation on categories and transaction and they are both connected with a one to many realtion in the database using EF- Entity Framework
where one category has many transactions and one transaction has one category.

==Challeneges==
1- Due to lack of time currently i had to rush and finish the project thus not taking my time to make the frontend part nicer.
2- Lack of decent resoruces for making modals but in the end I did it using ClaudeAi
